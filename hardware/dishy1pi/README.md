# Dishy1Pi Hardware

The hardware part of the Dishy1Pi project is a Raspberry Pi Hat board which interfaces the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins with the satellite dish motor controllers, encoders, and various sensors. An important aspect of this board is that the Raspberry Pi is optically isolated from the hardware connected to the satellite dish.

Although this project is tailored to controlling a satellite dish, it can also be used for controlling other motor control systems that require isolation and encoder feedback.

## Parts Library

The PCB will be assembled by JCLPCB. The project will require parts number identification to be compatible with LCSC part numbers. See [Library README](libs/README.md)
